# Pima Diabetes Analysis and Prediction Web App using Python and Streamlit

## Description

In this project, I aim to analyze diabetes data and address some important business problems/questions. 
I also build a logistic regression predictive model based on the prepared data and made a front-end application using Streamlit.

## Problem Statement

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Dataset Information

Below is the attribute information:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)

## Built with
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib and seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for front-end application)

## Web APP using Streamlit

- Used Anaconda for creating new environment
- Launched VS Code from that environment for coding the web app
- Installed all the packages including Streamlit that are used to build the model so that our web app will run without any error.
- After coding open the command prompt within that environment and run this command to run you app on browser.
> streamlit run app_name.py
- It'll deploy your app on localhost and run your app in your browser.
